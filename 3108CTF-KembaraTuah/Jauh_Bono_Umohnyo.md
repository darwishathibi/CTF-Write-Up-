## Methode
When I see number, I realize some thing that the combination is very similiar. HMmmmmmmm, I was thinking a bit and AHAA!! the number sequence is based on the legendary Nokia 3310 (tiga tiga sekupang)

Then, I traslate the number:
777 = "R"
33 = "E"
6 = "M"
22 = "B"
2 = "A"
88_6 = "U" dan "M" (underscore mungkin pemisah antara huruf)
666 = "O"
7777 = "S"
8_9 = "T" dan "W" (pemisah antara huruf)
2 = "A"
66 = "N"
8 = "T"
33 = "E"
3 = "D

it should be **REMBAU MOST WANTED**
