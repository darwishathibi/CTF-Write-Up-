# WebDecode
## Introduction
-**Event:** Pico CTF
-**Category:** Web Exploitation
-**Difficulity:** Easy

## Description
In this challenge, the objective is to analyze the login page, reverse-engineer its authentication mechanism, and uncover the correct credentials to retrieve the flag. This write-up details the process of inspecting the code, understanding Base64 encoding, and using logical reasoning to bypass the login and successfully capture the flag.

## Methode
I click the link that given and it redirect to the page. There is no any hints. Maybe it is a direct CTF question / challenge.

Inside the page, there is a simple login form. We just try to put any names and password, but it is just show an alert that our password is wrong. (It is a normal thing)

Then we open the inspect and immediately go to the **Sources** tab and find the **index.js** file. We go through the code and found something different.

Inside the code there is the part that show weird alphanumerics string:
```javascript
        for (const e in r)
            t[e] = btoa(document.querySelector(r[e]).value).replace(/=/g, "");
        return "YWRtaW4" !== t.u ? alert("Incorrect Username") : "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" !== t.p ? alert("Incorrect Password") : void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}.`)
```

There is one part of the code that told us the username and password will be change to the base64 through this:.
```javascript
t[e] = btoa(document.querySelector(r[e]).value).replace(/=/g, "");
```
The **btoa()** function in JavaScript is used to create a Base64-encoded string from binary data. Specifically, it encodes a string of text into Base64, which is a way of representing binary data in an ASCII string format. 

And then, we copy both **YWRtaW4** and **cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ** and paste it into [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%!
3D',true,false)&input=Y0dsamIwTlVSbnMxTTNKMk0zSmZOVE55ZGpOeVh6VXpjbll6Y2w4MU0zSjJNM0pmTlROeWRqTnlmUQ).

When the long alphanumeric string is decoded, the string is the **picoCTF{}** flag format. HAHAHA. However to complete the challenge we enter the encoded the username and password into the login form and obtained the flag.

## Flag
picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
