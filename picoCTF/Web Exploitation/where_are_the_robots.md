## Methode
At first, I dont understand what is the correlation between robots and website, the i google it. It find out that ["robots"](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/) is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers or robots (like search engine bots) about which pages or sections of the site should or shouldn't be crawled and indexed. Then i open the website.

Then is add "/robots.txt" in the path and found what is the "Disallow".

After that, delete the "/robots.txt" with the "8028f.html". Got the flag.
