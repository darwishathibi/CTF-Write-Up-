# WebDecode
## Introduction
**Event:** Pico CTF
**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Difficulity:** Easy

## Description
In this challenge, we are tasked with using the **web inspector** to locate the flag hidden within the webpage or associated files. The challenge suggests that the **flag may or may not be encoded, requiring** us to thoroughly examine various elements of the page, including its source code, scripts, and external resources. The provided hints guide us to check not only the HTML content but also any additional files linked by the page (e.g., JavaScript, CSS) to find the hidden flag.

They mock us, HAHHAHAHA lol

Anyway, I open the inspection by right click > Inspect or Ctrl+Shift+I and try to find any suspicious alphanumeric string. However I didn't find it.

I try to play the website by clicking any button inside it while the inspection is still open. Then suddenly at the **about** page. There is something suspisious.
