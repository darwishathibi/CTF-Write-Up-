# Uminify
## Introduction
-**Event:** Pico CTF
-**Category:** Web Exploitation
-**Difficulity:** Easy

## Description
In this challenge, we are asked to find the flag hidden in a minified webpage, where the code has been compressed to improve load times and readability by eliminating spaces and newlines. The hint suggests using browser developer tools to view the pageâ€™s source code and additional methods like CTRL+U or view-source: to examine the HTML. Although minification condenses the code, it doesn't change its functionality, and tools like text editors or browser developer tools can be used to format and analyze the code to uncover the hidden flag.

## Methode
After launch the instance, we click the link and redirect to page. Based on the hints given, the author told us to use **Ctrl + U** to view page source or **curl <url>** on web shell.

Anyway, We try 2nd methode, which is **Ctrl + U** as stated in the hints. Open the page and hit the **Ctrl + U**.

The html source look so long and we check the **Line wrap** button at the top-rigth of the page. We go through the source and found the **flag!!!**
